# EssenceEmporium
## What is this?
This is a GUI program built on Tkinter which displays the current worth of your League of Legends inventory in both *Blue Essence* and *Orange Essence* if you were to disenchant everything.
It also shows how much everything is worth at full price (i.e. not in shard form).

## Usage
Simply run the file with the League of Legends client open.
